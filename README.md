# concedii-with-orm
This project was a test case for my Bachelor Thesis.
It had at subject studying the difference between an ORM model and a project that does not have it.

There are plenty of things that could have been improved, but I only focused on the ORM aspect and the benefits it can provide

## Requirements to run the project
In order to run the project, you need the following ```JAVA, MySQL, Maven, GlassFish/Servlets```

After `Maven` is installed, go into the root of the document and run a `mvn install`
Soon after that, compile and run the code.

(You might need to insert users in the database)
